# FDB and Polytope model data access and processing

This repository contains examples for using [FDB](https://meteoswiss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IW2/pages/144150401/Realtime+FDB+for+ICON) and [Polytope](https://meteoswiss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IW2/pages/327780397/Polytope) to access ICON forecast data and process it using meteodata-lab.

## What is FDB

FDB allows to retrieve any multi-dimensional dataset of the recent real-time ICON NWP forecasts.
FDB is designed to access full horizontal fields (feature extraction is not supported) and it is only accessible from within CSCS.

### Jupyter Notebooks

The following notebook demonstrates how to access ICON model data (ICON-CH1-ENS & ICON-CH2-ENS) with FDB:
* [How to access model data with FDB from CSCS](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/nwp-fdb-polytope-demo/blob/main/notebooks/FDB/data_retrieve_from_FDB.ipynb)

### Installation
FDB data access requires the FDB libraries. In order to facilitate the use of the notebooks, we provide a jupyter kernel configuration for VSCode that will load the environment with the required libraries:

```
bash host/install_kernel.sh
```

#### From VSCode
(you might need to reload the window Ctrl-Shit P -> 'Developer: Reload Window' in order to let VSCode recognize the newly installed kernel)

Ctrl-Shift P -> 'Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel' -> 'Select Another Kernel' -> 'Jupyter Kernel' -> 'Polytope demo'

Also make sure the python extension of VScode is not in [restricted](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64723778/visual-studio-code-using-the-microsoft-python-extension-cannot-execute-code) mode

#### FDB environment for python
If you would like to develop python examples outside of the juypter notebooks, see https://meteoswiss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IW2/pages/144150401/Realtime+FDB+for+ICON#How-to-use-it how to use the FDB uenv environment .

## What is Polytope and Feature Extraction

Polytope allows to efficiently extract specific features from the same real-time ICON NWP forecast, such as grid point data, time-series, vertical profiles or polygons.
Polytope is an HTTP service and therefore access is not restricted to CSCS (it supports access from LabVM and ACPM).

### Jupyter Notebooks

The following notebooks demonstrate various use cases to access model data (ICON-CH1-EPS & ICON-CH2-EPS) via Polytope:

### Installation
Deploy your own python environment using the following commands. Alternatively, when working at CSCS, you can use the same [installation](#installation) mentioned above.

1. Install the poetry environment.
```
poetry install
```
2. Install the kernel.
```
poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name=polytope-env --display-name "polytope demo"
```

## Forecasts available in FDB

> [!NOTE]
> The realtime FDB normally contains **just the latest day of forecasts**. This means the FDB requests should usually use date = today and time as either 0000, 0300, 0600, 0900 etc. (given the forecasts run every 3 hour) for ICON-CH1-ENS and 0000, 0600, 1200 etc. for ICON-CH2-ENS. The data is usually available in the FDB a couple of hours after the forecast start time. If the requests to FDB return no data, see these [instructions](https://meteoswiss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IW2/pages/144150401/Realtime+FDB+ICON-CH1#Query-available-data-on-Balfrin) for how to query yourself which data is currently archived in the FDB.

## Development

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for how to update and publish notebooks consistently.
